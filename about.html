  </p>
  <h3> Since our humble beginnings in 1976, Bluto's has been providing legendary steaks and other delicious dishes to all
    who come to the great city of New York. Brainchild of Johnny Appleseed, he and his brother Bobby discovered the need
    for an authentic steak restaurant that the average man could afford, without sacrificing quality for price. It was
    that single idea which helped Bluto's grow into the establishment it is today. We continue the traditions put forth by Johhny
    and Bobby, always with spirit, enthusiasm, and love for the art of good tasting food. </h3>
